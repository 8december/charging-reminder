This '''test.py''' script will run everytime your laptop battery hits 21%, I know that windows has a option like that but it kicks in at 10% roughfly 
and its not healthy for battery to be that low and I haven't found a way to change it default settings .

Also if you want it to run every time you open your laptop make sure you copy these files and past in ''' %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup '''
location in side this startup folder. 
Just press ctrl + r and past this in the folder.
